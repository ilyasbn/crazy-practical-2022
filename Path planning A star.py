# To create the map on which we are going to apply the path planning algorithm, we are making use of :
# - a random generator that creates a map of size max_val x max_val (defined in the previous cell)
# - a random seed to ensure that the ouptut of the random generator is the same at each iteration
# - a threshold value which determines for each cell whether it is occupied (i.e. value set to 1) or free (i.e. value set to 0). 
# 
# You can play with these parameters to change the size of the map (map_size), density of the obstacles in the map (threshold) as well as their position (random seed).

# ## Implementing the Algorithm
# 
# The following implementation of the A* algorithm is based on the pseudo-code provided here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#Pseudocode
# 
# Make sure that you understand the different steps of the algorithm before starting to implement it. You are free however to choose another pseudo-code that corresponds to the A* algorithm implementation if you feel more comfortable with it. 

# The following functions provide the list of possible movements depending on whether you decide to have the algorithm work in a 4 connected or an 8 connected grid ([see here for a table recapitulating the difference](https://edoras.sdsu.edu/doc/matlab/toolbox/images/morph12.html)). You do not need to edit anything in these functions.

# Note that the heursitic here was chosen to be the Euclidian distance between the starting point and the goal. The choice of heuristic guides the search and will determine the speed at which the local optimum is found. A bad heursitic, such as a Manhattan distance in an 8 connected grid will however prevent you from finding the optimal solution because it does not take diagonals into account.
